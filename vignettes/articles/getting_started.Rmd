The `strongr` packages main functionality is to create complex workout-plans with simple tools. 

# Create a workout-plan

Each workout-plan is assembled from workouts which can be created with the `create_workout()` function.

```{r}
A <- 
  create_workout(
    exercise = c("benchpress", "squat", "deadlift"),
    step = c(2, 5, 5)
  )

B <-
  create_workout(
    exercise = c("overhead_press", "squat", "deadlift"),
    step = c(1, 5, 5)
  )
```

```{r}
plan <- 
  create_plan(
    start = lubridate::today(),
    end = lubridate::today() + 12 * 7,
    duration = NA,
    workouts = c(A, B),
  )
```
