> This package is very much work in progress!

## Overview

The goal of strongr is to allow easy creation of workout-plans and
logging of progress.

As of now the planned functions are:

-   `create_plan()`: Create a workout-plan from a set of input
    parameters and/or workouts.
-   `create_workout()`: Create a specific workout. One or more workouts
    can be used to create a plan.
-   `add_training()`: Add a training session to the workout-plan. You
    should be able to specifiy if a set was failed.
-   `get_next_training()`: Get weights (maybe with warmup weights) for
    the next training session.
-   `deload()`: Failed `x` sets in a row? Time to face the truth and
    deloadâ€¦
